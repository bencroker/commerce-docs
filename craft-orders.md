# craft.orders 

## How to get orders

You can access your siteâ€™s orders from your templates via `craft.orders`
It returns an [ElementQuery](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/element-queries.md) object.

```twig
{% set orders = craft.orders.all() %}

{% for order in orders %}
    {{ order.number }} - {{ order.totalPrice}} <br>
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

`craft.orders` supports the following parameters:

### type
Product Type model or handle.

### typeId
Product type id.

### number
The unique hash of the order.

### completed
Accepts `true`.  e.g ```{% set orders = craft.orders.completed(true).all() %}``` would 
return completed orders since they have `isCompleted` set to true.

### isCompleted
Accepts `1` or `not 1`.  e.g ```{% set orders = craft.orders.isCompleted('not 1').all() %}``` would 
return incomplete orders (carts) since they have `isCompleted` set to false.

### dateOrdered
The date the order was completed.

### orderStatus
accepts an `orderStatus` model.

### orderStatusId
Accepts the id of an Order Status.

### customer
A customer Model can be passed to get orders for that customer only. e.g `{% set orders = craft.orders.customer(craft.commerce.customer).all() %}`
Do not use this to get a cart, as the default response does not include orders that are still 
carts (use `{% set cart = craft.commerce.getCart %}` to get the current user's cart).

### user
A customer Model can be passed to get orders for that user only. e.g `{% set orders = craft.orders.user(currentUser).all() %}`
Do not use this to get a cart, as the default response does not include orders that are still 
carts (use `{% set cart = craft.commerce.getCart %}` to get the current user's cart).
