# craft.products

## How to get products

You can access your siteâ€™s products from your templates via `craft.products`
It returns an [ElementQuery](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/element-queries.md) object.

```twig
{% set products = craft.products.type('normal').all() %}

{% for product in products %}
  {% for variant in product.variants %}
    {{ variant.sku }} - {{ variant.salePrice }} <br>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

`craft.products` supports the following parameters:

### ID
The Product's element ID.

### type
Product Type model or handle.

### typeId
Product type ID.

### status
Only fetch products with the given status.

Possible values are 'live', 'pending', 'expired', 'disabled', and null.
The default value is 'live'. null will return all entries regardless of status.

An entry is 'live' if it is enabled, has a `availableOn` in the past and an `expiresOn` Date in the future.
An entry is 'pending' if it is enabled and has `availableOn` and `expiresOn` Dates in the future.
An entry is 'expired' if it is enabled and has `availableOn` and `expiresOn` Dates in the past.

### postDate
Fetch products based on their postDate.

### expiryDate
Fetch products based on their date of expiry.

### after
Fetch products based on available dates after this date.

### before
Fetch products based on their date available.

### defaultWeight
Fetch products based on the default variant's weight

### defaultHeight
Fetch products based on the default variant's height

### defaultLength
Fetch products based on the default variant's length

### defaultWidth
Fetch products based on the default variant's width

### defaultSku
Fetch products based on the default variant's sku

### hasVariant
Only return products where the `hasVariant` params would return one or more of the product's variants.

A variant query object can be passed or an array of query params. To see the available query params for variants, see [craft.variants](craft-variants.md).

For example, if you only wanted to return products where at least one variant's color field is red:

```twig
{% set products = craft.products.type('tshirt').hasVariant({ color: 'red' }) %}
```

You could alternatively do:

```twig
{% set variantQuery = craft.variant.color('red') %}
{% set products = craft.products.type('tshirt').hasVariant(variantQuery) %}
```
