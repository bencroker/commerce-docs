# Extendability

Commerce is a flexible and extensible platform, and just like Craft we have provided events to enable developers to add features to the system.

Events - Class docs coming soon.

[Purchasables](purchasables.md) — Add an element to the system that is sellable.

[Adjusters](adjusters.md) — Make any price adjustment to an order.

[Shipping Methods](shipping-methods.md) — Add 3rd Party shipping methods and return shipping prices.
