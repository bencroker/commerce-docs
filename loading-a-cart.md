# Loading a Cart

It is possible to load an active or inactive cart into the current customer's session.

There are two possible methods to do this, you are able to load the cart [using a form](#using-a-form-to-load-a-cart) or [via a URL](#using-a-url-to-load-a-cart).

In both methods and errors that may occur will be returned in the session error flash data.

::: tip
If the cart being loaded belongs to a user, the user must be logged in to load it into their session.

## Using a form to load a cart

Loading a cart using a form requires the passing of a cart `number` to the `commerce/cart/load-cart` action.

A working example can be seen in the [example templates](example-templates.md). Below is a simplified version of that form.

```twig
<form method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="commerce/cart/load-cart"/>
    {{ redirectInput('/shop/cart') }}

    <input type="text" name="number" value="">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## Using a URL to load a cart

This method uses the Commerce load cart action endpoint. There are a couple of way this URL can be retrieved. Commerce provides
a setting ([Commerce::\$loadCartRedirectUrl](configuration.md#loadcartredirecturl)) that allows you to specified the URL a customer
will be redirected to after the cart has been loaded.

### Using Twig

```twig
{% set loadCartUrl = actionUrl('commerce/cart/load-cart', { number: cart.number }) %}
```

### Using PHP

```php
use craft\helpers\UrlHelper;
â€¦
$loadCartUrl = UrlHelper('commerce/cart/load-cart', ['number' => $cart->number]);
```

::: tip
This method can be useful in an email, allowing customers to retrieve an abandoned cart.
