# Installation

## Pre-flight check

Before installing Craft Commerce, make sure you’ve got everything you need:

* A web host that meets Commerce’s [minimum server requirements](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/requirements.md) (hint: you’ll need PHP 5.4 or later).
* Craft CMS 3.0 or later (see Craft’s [installation instructions](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/installation.md) for details).

## Plugin Store

Craft Commerce can only be installed from the plugin store, or through composer.
